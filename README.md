Weather Search App

This is a small demo app designed to search for weather information for a location using the AccuWeather API. Users can enter the location or zip code of a place and click the search button to retrieve hourly updated information.

How to run: config Flutter SDK path in your IDE(Android Studio, Visual Code,etc... then run it from file main.dart

If you encounter errors such as "Class is not defined," etc., try running this command in cmd (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS) or the integrated terminal in your IDE:

=> *flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs*

**Note**: Due to account limitations, you can only look up weather information 50 times a day as this is a free AccuWeather account.
