# Weather Search App

This is a small demo app designed to search for weather information for a location using the AccuWeather API. Users can enter the location or zip code of a place and click the search button to retrieve hourly updated information.

**Note**: Due to account limitations, you can only look up weather information 50 times a day as this is a free AccuWeather account.
